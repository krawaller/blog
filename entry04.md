# A bit overhwelmed
2015-11-06 11:00

After going through all the material on React, React Router and Redux I feel a bit overhwelmed. It feels like I got answer to many of my thoughts and questions. And I realised my questions weren't silly after all.
Ahead there is large piece of work to do, get into using all the stuff. As usually I it's going to challenging from the beginning and then hopefully the flow will come along as soon as the pieces have fallen into place. I'm looking forward getting to know the possibilities and limitations of the framework and tools.

[David](http://blog.krawaller.se/riaguild2015/#/member/krawaller): A bit late now, but - one thing I've realised after talking to others in the same situation is that I should've told you explicitly to start by reading up on just React, not minding Redux and the Router at all. Just go through the [Getting started section](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) on React's homepage, and learn about components, props and state in peace. And THEN, only when you've got those things down, do you move on to Redux / The Router.

But, as said, too late now. Sorry about that. :P
